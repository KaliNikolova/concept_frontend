# User Journey

Alex logs into Current and is greeted by her task list from previous days. Wanting to bring order to the clutter, she begins rearranging her priorities, dragging tasks up and down until they reflect what truly matters. She moves "6.104 Assignment 4a" to the top and switches to Focus Mode, where the app prompts her to start working on it. After completing the task, she marks it as done, and the change is instantly reflected in her main list. Remembering she still needs to submit the Google Form for that assignment, Alex adds a new task, "Finish 4a - 6.104," and places it at the top as her most urgent item. Feeling organized, she navigates to Plan My Day, where she reviews her fixed events, quickly adds her club meeting, and taps Plan Day. The app automatically schedules her tasks from the current time, creating a balanced plan that feels both structured and achievable. With her day now clearly laid out and her mind at ease, Alex logs out feeling calm, focused, and in control.
